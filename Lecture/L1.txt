Why Typescript + React?
1. With static type checking, you get to learn about potential bugs as you're typing the code, than heading to the browser and figuring out at runtime.
2. Provides a way to describe the shape of an object hence providing better documentation and autocomplete.
3. Makes maintaince and refactoring of large code bases much easier.


Use types when building applications.
Use interfaces when building libraries.
